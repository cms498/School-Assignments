SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Chris Shepard

================================================================
Part 1
Estimated Time 0:45 min
Plan:
- use getchar and take the users input to put into the array
- if length counter is greater then zero return length
otherwise its and EOF and return -1
- all printing done in main

Complete
Error Number: 1
Complie Number: 17
Actual Time 1:15 min
Observations
- using getchar worked, same with the logic for EOF
- i was getting extra memory at the end of the array, or
something the words typed would get cut off or have extra 
characters, I had to remever that with char arrays you need
the special char added \0
- arrays are pass by refrence so if the users input was
shorter then their previous, it would have old chars still in
the array
- i understood why it wasn't working but the implementation
took longer then expected as I forgot about the ending char

================================================================
Part 2
Estimated Time 0:20 min
Plan:
- loop over until maxline and set to array at index to
from array at index
- add variables to hold the longest word and to hold the 
longest word length, write logic to determine if it 
is greater then the previous
- print at end

Complete
Error Number: 1
Complie Number: 7
Actual Time: 25 min
Observations
- copy function passed all tests first try
- logic in main wasn't terrible, big issue is that i had a var
in the while loop so it was reseting everytime, so the
comparison were true everytime
- no other issues, i remebered that you can print a char array
using %s
