SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Chris Shepard

================================================================
Implement code to pass all unit tests

Estimated Time	2:00
Plan:
- utilize the getchar method along with the helper functions
provided to loop through the field, use the end of string
char to properply terminate the char array, return the char
- for printinng find the min value between the nfields of
the two structs, loop from zero the that min value
and use the printf function to display properly
- for getline, use a while loop and conditionals to 
fill out the fields, keep track of the nfield count in and out
of the loop

Complete
Actual Time	3:00
Observations:
- get_line function is where I ran into a majority of my issues
- i had to create another variable to keep track of the index
of the field struct
- I had to look in the slides and online for how to create
a typdef struct, overall just many issues that added time


================================================================
Test correct operation from the command line

Estimated Time	0:30
Plan:
- go through each function at a time and created arrays of values
- utilize printf to double check
- also use the provided food output file

Complete
Actual Time	0:30
Observations:
- no real issues, everything worked as expected
