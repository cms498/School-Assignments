SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Chris Shepard

================================================================
Part 2 (Part 1 not required)
Estimated Time: 0:30 min
Plan:
- fix all of the variable names to be in proper conventions
- eliminate all magic numbers
- add proper commenting and documentation
- go through the rest of the proper c styling document and make
  proper changes slowly
- re run the code each time something major is changed

Complete
Total Time: 0:25 min
Observations:
- writing code properly can make understanding it after the
fact significantly easier, even though I didn't write the
code I was able to understand it
- I ran into no problems, there were no obstacles to 
overcome
