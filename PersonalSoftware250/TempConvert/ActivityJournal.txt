SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Chris Shepard

===================================================================
Start Part 1
Estimated Time 0:20
Plan:
- Use a for loop starting from zero, going to 300 inclusive, increasing by
twenty each time, implement the formula without formatting, implement 
proper formatting using printf. 

Complete
Actual Time 0:25, 4 compiles with errors
Observations:
- The loop worked with no issues, however the actual implementation of the
formula was harder then expected, I forgot about the rounding down of 5/9 so
everything came out to zero
- Using the printf formatting was easier then expected, it just required
me to go slow and think hard about the strange characters I was typing


====================================================================
Start Part 2
Estimated Time 0:10
Plan:
- change my celcius variable to a double, change the formula to use decimals,
change the formatting in the printf to right justify and use one decimal point

Complete
Actual Time 0:05, 2 complies with errors
Observations:
- making a plan before hand helps a ton with the work going by faster, I was
able to implemeny my plan with almost no issue, a majoirty of my complies
were to check if the formatting is correct
- no obstacles to overcome, just have to keep practicing with the printf
