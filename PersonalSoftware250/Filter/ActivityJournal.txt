SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Chris Shepard

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	2:00
Plan:
- first i am going to implement the functions with indexing
not having to worry about memory issues
- I will then go problem by problem looking back over the slides
as I go
- after every function I will use valgrin and check that I freed
all of the memory
- itll be key to remeber refrencing and defrencing with pointers

Complete
Actual Time	~3:00
Observations:
- memory allocation and dealocation is hard to get the hang of
- I ran into many valgrind issues as I wasn't entirely sure what
I was looking at
- luckily the substr function worked almost first try, it 
helped to draw out a picture first
- i'm starting to the get hang of pointers
- the removing the values from the other string took a long time
- i forgot that I need to put the pointer back at the start
once a loop is done with
