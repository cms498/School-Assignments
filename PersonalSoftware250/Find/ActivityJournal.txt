SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Chris Shepard

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	2:00
Plan:
- complete all of the index questions first, then move onto the
pointers
- look back and make sure to derefrence when necessary
- push one at a time
- read the tips at the top of the assignment as they show
how pointers work

Complete
Actual Time	1:30
Observations:
- there were instances where using pointers made more sense 
then using array indexing
- the substring one took up a majority of the time, 
i was left with one or two errors after every compile
- i had to remember to check for empty characters in
my copies before increasing the index
- other 4 problems were quicker
