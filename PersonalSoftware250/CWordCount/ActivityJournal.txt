SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Chris Shepard

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time: 1:30 min
Plan:
- write three loops to keep track of one each either words, chars, or lines
- determine if we are at the end of a line, chars should increase no matter what each time the 
loop executes
- words, see if there is a blank space, increase counter by one
- test each at one times using the DarkAndStormyNight.txt file

Complete
Actual Time: 3:00
Observations:
- three loops didn't work as the file will not "start from the top" after being read through
- lines and chars implementation worked well
- word counter had umexpected issues, as some lines were blank or had multiple spaces,
using getchar() with another variable caused many issues
- I need more practice with loops as well as looking over the documentation for the #includes
as they contained lots of helpful info with helper functions pre built in
