SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Chris Shepard

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	1:00
Plan:
- read over the documentation, add parameter pointers to the 
.h file, user loops and arrays to check for the $ character
- use the built in atoi and atof features in main for the
conversions
- create the makefile using the slides

Complete
Actual Time	1:15
Observations:
- overall the assignment went pretty well, being thrown into
a project with just a boiler plate can be hard at first
- only real issue can within the Makefile as i was spelling
it MakeFile, so the compiler didn't work
- issue in read_data.c fixed, as I was missing the first num
in the doubles and int, I called getchar() one to many times
