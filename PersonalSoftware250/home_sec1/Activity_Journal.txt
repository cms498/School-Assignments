===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start 7:00
Estimated Time	45 min
Plan:
- write all of the printing and initilizes functions
- look over the .h files to see formating for the data vector
- make the events and print them

Complete 8:15 
Actual Time	1:15 min
Observations:
- c++ is hard
- print statements dont come with spaces
- only error involved the intruder events when creating and loading
them in the loadData method

===========  Stage 2  ==========================================
Start 8:15
Estimated Time	1:00 min
Plan:
- add the events to the pointer array and increase the appropriate
amounts
- change all of the print functions
- write HomeEvent::Print()

Complete 10:00
Actual Time	1:30 min
Observations:
- OOP in c++ and dealing with the namespace is very hard
- printing worked with other methods, only thing that gave
trouble was in the loadData

===========  Stage 3  ==========================================
Start 10:00
Estimated Time	1:00 min
Plan:
- keep track of the rooms, dont worry about seg faults, fix
printing issue from level 2

Complete 10:50
Actual Time	50 min
Observations:
- we don't need to keep track of the rooms at all the main does
that for us, attempting to fix the printing issue resulted 
in even more seg faults

===========  Stage 4  ==========================================
Start 11:00 
Estimated Time	1:00 min
Plan:
- use if statements to check for bounds conditions, this will
make our buffer work
- potentially make a helper function

Complete
Actual Time	1:30 min
Observations:
- our logic works however the printing is still wrong, the values
are correct but the actual order is word, ours is based
on the events in order, compared to the output which is based 
on the oldest event

===========  Stage 5  ==========================================
Start 12:25
Estimated Time	0 min
Plan:
- do nothing, the code should do the work for is in main.cpp

Complete
Actual Time	5 min
Observations:
- printing is still wrong, but the rest of the code works

===========  PROJECT PART 1 SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================
C++ is a very weird language to learn, I knew what i wanted to do
but figuring out the syntax on how to write it out took a 
ton of time, dealing with the printing and * & took some
getting used too. The project wasn't too hard, it was just a lot
of things to kinda grasp, the documentation was very long and hard
to follow in the beginning, but as time went on it got much more
manageable once i knew what it wanted me to do. Dealing with 
the circular buffer was the worst part, we had the idea 
together, but the actual implemenation took a bit. It took more time 
then expected for most things, but it was fairly accurate. Once
we realized that we didn't need to keep track of the rooms and that
the main file did all of that for us, it became much more manageable
