I learned that you can attempt to establish a connection to any server for the most part
How can you create your own server
WHy do you get IP banned when you try and conncet to the date and time server if you 
do it more then once every 4 seconds

I learned that you don't need to establish an internet connection in order to send messages
to other people
Is there a way to guarantee UDP always sends all packets
Is there a process that uses a combination of UDP and TCP/IP

I learned that you can create a multi threaded server pretty easily, all you need to do is

What other network patterns exist
I have no other questions
