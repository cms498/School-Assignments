I learned that you can multiple programs at one time using multi threading
I wish i knew more about the thread processor and exactly how it works, 
I bet there is a way under the hood to control this processor
I have no more questions for today

I learned that threads can be put to sleep but not by other threads
I wish i knew more about how the sleep method gets off track eventually
and how to potentially mitigate that, I also learned about race conditions
I have no more questions for today
